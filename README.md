## Learnings from the Project

This project is my 2nd web development project so, developing this website has been a valuable learning experience. Here are some of the key learnings:

- **API Integration:** Gained hands-on experience in fetching data from an external API using the `fetch()` method, which means getting data from an external server. 
- **JavaScript Proficiency:** Improved my skills in JavaScript programming, particularly in areas such as DOM manipulation and advanced concepts like async-await, promises, callbacks for handling asynchronous operations.
